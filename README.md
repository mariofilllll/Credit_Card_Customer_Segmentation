# Machine Learning Project

## Description
This project demonstrates the development and evaluation of machine learning models using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Included Files
- **Progetto 8.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook with machine learning code and analysis.

## Objectives
- Build and train machine learning models for prediction tasks.  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy and precision.  
- Use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to prepare and clean the data.

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook
