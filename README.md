# Credit Card Customer Segmentation

## Description
This project uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment credit card customers based on their behavior and spending patterns. The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers for targeted marketing and service optimization.

## Included Files
- **Progetto 8.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow for data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
- **credit_card_customers.csv:** Dataset with customer information (downloaded dynamically).

## Objectives
- Preprocess and clean customer data.  
- Standardize the data for clustering.  
- Apply the K-Means algorithm to segment customers.  
- Use PCA for dimensionality reduction and cluster visualization.

## Features
- **Clustering:** Grouping customers with similar behaviors using K-Means.  
- **Elbow Method:** Determining the optimal number of clusters.  
- **Visualization:** PCA-based 2D visualization of customer clusters.

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook
